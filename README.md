# Pizza-Runner

###  Problem Overview
Pizza Runner, a food delivery company, faces challenges in optimizing its operations and understanding customer preferences. Key areas for improvement include:

Delivery Efficiency: How can delivery times and runner speeds be improved?

Customer Insights: What are customer ordering patterns and preferences?

Ingredient Optimization: How can ingredient usage be optimized and costs minimized?

Revenue Analysis: How much revenue has been generated, and whatâ€™s the profit after delivery costs?

### Project Overview
This project showcases my problem solving skills through the analysis of Pizza Runner data, a food delivery company. The primary objective of the project was to support business decision making by analyzing operational and customer data.

In this project, I applied various SQL techniques, aggregate function,  joins, window functions for data analysis. I used CTEs for temporary result sets and subqueries for efficient analysis. Constraints were applied to ensure data integrity.

### Project Structure

* Database Setup: The database is created along with all necessary tables, including constraints to ensure data integrity.
* Data Import: Sample data is inserted into the database to simulate real-world scenarios.
* Data Cleaning: Data integrity is ensured through handling empty strings, trimming spaces, and removing inconsistencies. 
* Business Problem Solving: Over 25 business problems are addressed using SQL queries. This includes analyzing delivery performance, customer ordering trends, and financial metrics. 

### Methodology

* Database Design:

The first step was to design the database schema based on the business requirements, ensuring that all relevant data points (e.g., customer orders, runner deliveries, pizza recipes) were captured.

* Data Cleaning:

The raw data was cleaned to ensure that empty strings, unnecessary spaces, and inconsistencies were addressed. This step was crucial for accurate analysis.

* SQL Analysis:

SQL queries were used to solve key business problems. This involved using a range of techniques including:

Joins (to merge data from multiple tables).

Window functions (for ranking and advanced aggregation).

CTEs and Subqueries (for organizing complex queries).

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) to derive insights from the data.
