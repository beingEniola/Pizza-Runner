SQL Analysis:

SQL queries were used to solve key business problems. This involved using a range of techniques including:

Joins (to merge data from multiple tables).

Window functions (for ranking and advanced aggregation).

CTEs and Subqueries (for organizing complex queries).

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) to derive insights from the data.

Deliverables:

A set of SQL queries and the analysis of the data was provided to help Danny make informed decisions about Pizza Runnerâ€™s operations. This includes performance metrics, customer insights, and financial evaluations.
